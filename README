nessashot is a simulator and modeler for Pokemon UNITE.  It uses data scraped
from external sources (http://unite-db.com) to graph and display game data.

The goal of this project is to be as portable as possible.  It has no external
dependencies (other than JavaScript) and makes use of no recent additions to the
ECMAScript language to ensure maximum compatibility.

This project can be used to model, compare, and optimize various builds.  The
output is intended to be generic enough that it can be dropped into other
projects effortlessly.  A command-line interface is provided as a reference.

In order to utilize nessashot fully, you first must generate the necessary
scripts pokemon.js and emblems.js.  This can be done by running the
updateversion script to download the most recent versions of the stats, moves,
and emblems JSON files.  Then, run the genpoke and genemb scripts to create the
missing JavaScript files.

Another file (preproc.ini) is an INI-style configuration file that can be used
to better model the JSON file into usable JavaScript.
